### What I learned

While building the QR Code component, I deepened my understanding of the following core web development concepts:

- HTML Structure: I practiced writing clean and semantic HTML to structure the component correctly. This included using container elements and image tags to display the QR code.
- CSS Layout Techniques: I used modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or CSS Grid to center the QR component both vertically and horizontally within the viewport. This helped improve the layout and responsiveness.
- Styling and Design: I applied custom styles to create a visually appealing card-like component.
- Responsive Design: I ensured the component looks good on various screen sizes.
- File Organization: I kept the HTML and CSS in separate, well-organized files for maintainability and reusability.

This project was a great way to strengthen my front-end fundamentals and pay attention to detail in UI layout and design.
